# THE SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT.

#### This repository holds files that we used to create our own simple_shell under simple_shell  project.

## INTRODUCTION.

#### A shell is a computer program which exposes an operating systems service to human user or other programs. It is a program that runs other programs (or commands) and manages the interaction between a human and the operating system by using either Command-Line Interface (CLI) or Graphical User Interface (GUI), depending on a computerâ€™s role and particular operation. 

### Description.
#### This is a simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh). Additional functions are also included. This program was written entirely in C as a milestone project for Alx-Holberton School.

### Installation.
#### Clone this repository into your working directory. Files should be compiled with GCC and the following flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -Wno-format.
